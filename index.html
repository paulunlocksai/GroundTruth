                <h1>WELCOME</h1>
                <p class="lead">"Ground truth" is the data that AI models are trained on. It's also the perfect metaphor for what we're building here: cutting through the noise to get to what's real in AI.</p>

                <h2>WHY</h2>
                <p>AI is evolving at breakneck speed. To make sense of it, we need to cut through the noise and get signal from the people building the future. That's what Ground Truth delivers: collective wisdom from those on the front lines.</p>

        <section class="what">
            <div class="container">
                <h2>WHAT</h2>
                <p>A private monthly roundtable. Builders sharing knowledge and debating the most pressing issues in AI technology, business, UX, and ethics.</p>

            <div class="container">
                <h2>WHO</h2>
                <p>A carefully curated group of founders, execs, engineers, designers and PMs actively shaping AI-powered products and services. Because we believe that the best source of what's real isn't the headlines, it's the builders on the ground.</p>

                <h2>THE FORMAT</h2>
                <p>We discuss 2-3 timely topics at each session. The week prior members receive a briefing to get their thoughts flowing and prep for the discussion. Past topics have included "Measuring Productivity in an AI-First World" and "The LLM Performance Plateau." Each session also includes an "Insights" slot where members share what they've learned recently as builders. Members also have access to a private Slack channel to continue the discussion.</p>
